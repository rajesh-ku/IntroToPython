    "## Built-in data types in Python\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Any data or information stored within a Python variable has a *type*. You can view the type of data stored within a variable using the `type` function.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Python has several built-in data types for storing different kinds of information in variables. Following are some commonly used data types:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Static Data Type\r\n",
    "1. Integer - arbitrary precision integer\r\n",
    "2. Float - 64 bit floating point number\r\n",
    "3. Boolean - true / false\r\n",
    "4. None - null values\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Object Type\r\n",
    "5. String\r\n",
    "6. List\r\n",
    "7. Tuple\r\n",
    "8. Dictionary\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Integer, float, boolean, None, and string are *primitive data types* because they represent a single value. Other data types like list, tuple, and dictionary are often called *data structures* or *containers* because they hold multiple pieces of data together.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Integer Data Types\r\n",
    "It allows `unlimited precision signed intered` meaning you can use as many didgit as you need!"
